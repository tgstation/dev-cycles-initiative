# Dev Cycles Initiative
This is the hub for issues related to the [Dev Cycles Initiative](https://github.com/orgs/tgstation/projects/11), with the current goal being to get sub-30 second initialization times on MetaStation without configs.

This may in the future provide useful information and tools, such as profiling or Tracy dumps.
